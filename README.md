# FirstJavaFXGUI
My First JavaFX GUI for practice
## About
Well, I tried making a GUI project using JavaFX. Initially, was confused between JavaFX and swing itself! XD. But, anyway, this is for my University Java for Beginners course.
## The Project
It is a simple window with two menus and a button.
The Event handling procedure are simple print statements that are printed in the command console.

## Software
I used IntelliJ community Edition as that felt easier to me than Ecllipse.
